Stack overflow crash with high settings:

4 - LAMP
/33 - red LED
2,14,15 - SD 1 bit mode 4,12,13 - SD 4 bit mode
4 - RXD0 (intentionally connected to LED pin(4) to free pin 3 for REC button)   
1 - TXD0 (debug output)
12 - RXD2 (mavlink)
13 - TDX2 (mavlink)

Various notes:
1. Camera should be initialzied with highgest settings (UXGA, jpeg quality < 4) to preallocate large buffers. 
 Settings can be changed later. Otherwise app will likely crash on some high frame size.

2. Sharpness and denoise are not supported in esp32-camera library for ov2640.
 It is impossible to get good image outdoors with automatic sharpness. Camera enables blur when sky is seen in the large part of frame.
 So all you get is blurry footage in the air. Sharpness should be set to level 2 or 3 using direct registers manipulation.

3. SD Write speed in 1-bit mote is almost the same as in 4-bit mode. Should use 1-bit mode to free spare pins.

4. SD Write speed fluctuate a lot (updating FAT?)

5. ov2640 is capable of dumping 800x600 30FPS max on 24Mhz. esp32 can do 20Mhz only, so max fps is 30*20/24 = 25.

6. There are 3 'pixel-skipping' modes: 1600x1200, 800x600 and 400x296.  Other modes are just window inside theese modes.
So while 800x600 can do 25FPS, 1024x768 are significantly slover ( 12.5 FPS) because camera parses full 1600x1200 matrix.
It is not possible to get good FPS in 1280x720 mode unfortunatelly (should 3MP or 5MP camera improve situation?).

6. Windowing from 800x600 to 800x452 allows to decrease JPEG size by 30%.

7. Lamp LED is ~100mA. Better should be replaced with small LED + 300Ohm resistor.

8. Total power consumption without lamp is ~300mA.

9. Max SDCard size is 32GB.
